# IITM-Moodle-Course-Downloader
This is a python code for downloading course content from Moodle automatically for IITM Students. This code wasn't actually made by me. I found it while going through GitHub.

This code sorts your files into different folders subject wise too!
Open the code in gedit and enter your username and password in the "PUT_USERNAME/PASSWORD_HERE"

This code makes use of Beautiful Soup 4 library so make sure you have it first.
