# IITM-Moodle-Course-Downloader
This is a python code for downloading course content from Moodle automatically for IITM Students. Almost all of this project was done by Kunal Grover, a senior of mine at IITM.

This code sorts your files into different folders subject wise too!

This code makes use of Beautiful Soup 4 library so make sure you have it first.
